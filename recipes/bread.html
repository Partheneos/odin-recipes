        <h3>About This Recipe</h3>
        <p>Humans have been making bread for thousands 
            of years and this recipe is as close to that 
            bare-bones tradition as you can get. Perhaps 
            only difference would be that in our modern 
            recipes, we include yeast that allows the bread
            to rise.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Cups of All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>2 Cups of Water</li>
            <li>2 Tsp. of Salt</li>
            <li>2 1/4 Tsp. of Yeast, or One Standard Packet</li>
            <li>About 1 Tbsp. of Sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the sugar in the water. Ideally the water will
                be warm but not hot. Mix in the yeast and set aside 
                to allow yeast to activate.
            </li>
            <li>In a separate larger bowl, mix the flour and salt.</li>
            <li>Once the yeast has activated, slowly mix the yeast 
                mixture in with the flour. Mix thoroughly, but there's
                no need to knead.
            </li>
        </ol>
